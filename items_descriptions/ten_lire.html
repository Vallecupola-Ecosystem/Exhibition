              Imagine jingling coins in your pocket half a century ago in Rome. Among them is the light, silvery-grey
              10-lire piece, only 1.6 grams yet worth enough for a fresh espresso. Minted from aluminium between 1951
              and
              2001, this tiny disc shows two proud symbols of Italy’s post-war hopes.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the front (obverse) a farmer’s plough cuts through soil under the words “REPVBBLICA ITALIANA”. Flip it
              and you find twin wheat ears framing the number 10, celebrating food and growth. Designers Giuseppe
              Romagnoli and Pietro Giampaoli wanted every Italian to feel the nation’s rebirth in their hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the coin is so light, children used to skip it across fountains like a pebble.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today forty billion examples survive, making it one of the most common European coins ever struck, yet
              collectors still search early dates like 1956 or the low-mintage 1965 proof. Next time you spot the tiny
              olive branch and plough, remember the big dreams they once financed.

              Light as a movie ticket yet loaded with symbolism, Italy’s aluminium 10-lire coin became the pocket
              soundtrack of the post-war economic miracle. Issued first in 1951, the round disc measured 23.3 mm,
              weighed
              only 1.6 g, and cost the mint less than its face value to strike.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the obverse sculptor Giuseppe Romagnoli placed a forward-leaning plough, engraved by Pietro Giampaoli,
              under the legend “REPVBBLICA ITALIANA”. The reverse balances two ears of wheat around the big number 10,
              with a hidden olive twig nodding to peace.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the boom years the coin bought tram rides, espresso shots, or morning newspapers; more than four
              billion pieces rolled from the Rome presses. Yet rarity exists: only 1.05 million pieces bear the 1965
              date,
              making that year the key collector target. By the 1990s, vending machines ignored the denomination and
              schoolchildren used it as a tiddlywink.

            <p><strong>Designing Recovery</strong><br />
              Mint director Giuseppe Romagnoli chose rural motifs—plough, wheat, olive twig—to celebrate food security
              and
              peace in 1951. Aluminium, surplus from war industries, fit the need for billions of low‑value coins.</p>
            <p><strong>Production &amp; Circulation</strong><br />
              Schuler presses in Rome struck up to 650 pieces/minute. A tram ride cost ten lire; by 1980 the coin bought
              little, but vending machines loved its weight and magnetic neutrality.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Soundtrack</strong><br />
              Street vendors rattled rolls; children played tiddlywinks; students tossed handfuls during 1968
              protests—“silver rain” despite the dull metal.</p>
            <p><strong>Numismatic Nuances</strong><br />
              Collectors examine rim width, digit shape, and micro‑mintmarks. Aluminium bruises easily; mint‑state coins
              live in inert flips with silica gel.</p>
            <p><strong>End of an Era</strong><br />
              Euro conversion priced one coin at 0.52 euro‑cent. Most ended in charity boxes; some became key‑rings. Yet
              the plough and wheat still whisper stories of work, growth, and light‑hearted hope.</p>

            <p>💿✨ Flip a coin, time-travel to pre-euro Italy! Meet the feather-light 10-lire: 23 mm of recycled
              aluminium, minted 1951–2001, plough on one side, wheat on the other. Farmers and baristas, punks and
              priests—all felt its jingle.</p>
            <p>Fast facts: weighs 1.6 g (lighter than one gummy bear), alloy descended from WW2 aircraft, legal tender
              until February 2002. Hardest date? 1965—only one million struck. Commonest? 1955, 275 million. Value
              today:
              pocket lint, unless pristine—then coffee money.</p>
