              The
              sculpture is called <em>Dancers</em> and is made of bronze. It was sculpted by Angelo Di Mario in 1986
              and
              is now in his House Museum in Vallecupola. This small mountain village is just bursting with art! </p>
            <p>This statue is made to look light and moving, as if the graceful dance was meant to last forever. And
              just
              like in fairy tales or dreams, every shape here tells a story. Want to see it up close? There are many

            <p>The sculpture <em>Ballerini</em> (Angelo Di Mario, 1986) is a bronze work measuring 35√ó32 cm kept at
              the
              Angelo Di Mario House Museum Library in Vallecupola. It depicts two figures dancing, stylised and united
              in
              a fluid gesture. The material seems to defy its heaviness, tending towards a compositional lightness
              that
              recalls harmony, rhythm and grace.</p>
            <p>The work is one of approximately 300 sculptures created by the artist, many of which are now on display
              in
              a gallery set up in the Casa Museo thanks to the support of the Lazio Region (Annual Plan 2023). The
              gallery
              - designed by Jacopo Eusepi and Massimo Lauricella - hosts around 30 small works in an installation
              reminiscent of the shape of a beehive, enhancing the dialogue between art, poetry and territory.</p>

            <p>Created in 1986, the sculpture <em>Dancers</em> is a bronze work by Angelo Di Mario (1925-2013),
              exhibited
              at the Library House Museum in Vallecupola. The composition depicts two dancers wrapped in an ascending,
              fluid gesture, where the bronze loses its staticity to assume an internal dynamism. It is not just a
              representation of dance: it is the tension between body and space, between gesture and form.</p>
            <p>Di Mario, a self-taught and deeply cultured artist, integrates references to classicism, the Etruscan
              world, but also influences from the second half of the 20th century into his production. His works move
              between the raw material and the polished symbol, in a sculpture capable of accommodating light,
              emptiness
              and meaning.</p>
            <p>Stone - or bronze, in this case - for Di Mario is not just support, but memory: ‚Äúmute witness‚Äù that
              speaks
              to those who know how to listen. Even <em>Ballerini</em> seems to sculpt time itself, transforming a
              fleeting moment into an eternal form.</p>
            <p>The sculpture can now be seen in the Art Gallery of the Library House Museum, created thanks to the
              contribution of the Lazio Region. Each work is accompanied by a poem, testifying to Di Mario's
              multifaceted
              vocation: poet, sculptor, etruscologist.</p>
            <p>Andrea Alessi (critic and head of the Acquapendente Museum) writes about his sculpture, praised by
              critics
              such as Luigi Tallarico:</p>
            <blockquote>
              Hard, strong, immortal like stone, and yet at the same time fragile, delicate and flexible
              like the plastic forms that slide fast, fluctuate and conquer their autonomy
              in space. This is the feeling that emerges when viewing the entire sculptural production
              of Angelo di Mario (1925-2013). Of a multi-purpose work, i.e. one that resists
              the inexorable passage of time, that is eternal and maintains its qualities
              unaltered over the centuries, but that similarly is also the carrier of a poetic message,
              the artistic expression of an authentic and transparent soul.
            </blockquote>
