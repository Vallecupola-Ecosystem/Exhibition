                        <p>
                            <strong>Usil</strong> is a site-specific installation created in 2019 by contemporary
                            Italian
                            artist Agapito Miniucchi, exhibited at the Aurelio De Felice – CAOS Museum in Terni. The
                            work
                            takes its title and inspiration from the Etruscan sun-deity Usil, reinterpreting ancient
                            myth
                            through modern materials and form. Composed primarily of carved and assembled wood
                            panels—measuring 166 cm high, 50 cm wide, and 75 cm deep—the installation combines
                            sculptural
                            relief with painted surfaces to evoke the sun’s radiance and the mythic aura of its divine
                            bearer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Miniucchi’s <em>Usil</em> fuses minimalist geometry with rich symbolic motifs: stylized
                            rays,
                            angular wings, and circular apertures recall both archaic depictions of the god and solar
                            iconography across cultures. The warm, honeyed tones of the wood are enhanced by subtle
                            washes
                            of gold and ochre paint, producing a luminescent effect under gallery lighting. In
                            commissioning
                            the piece, the Comune di Terni sought to bridge local heritage with contemporary
                            art—Miniucchi’s
                            installation thus stands as a dialog between past and present, ritual and display.

                            Step into the CAOS Museum’s gallery and you’ll be met by <em>Usil</em>, a soaring wooden
                            structure that channels the power of the Etruscan sun-god. At eye level, the central
                            figure—an
                            abstracted, winged silhouette—appears to emerge from the plane of the wall, its carved
                            contours
                            catching light and shadow with every degree of your turn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reach out and brush your fingertips over the smooth, sanded panels. You’ll feel the gentle
                            undulations where the rays extend—each a precise bevel that radiates outward like a compass
                            rose. The warm wood grain underpins a wash of translucent gold: not an opaque veneer, but a
                            whisper of pigment that glimmers as you pass.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Step back a pace. The installation fills your peripheral vision, its verticality (166 cm
                            tall)
                            dominating the space without overwhelming it. The broader wingspan (50 cm each side) and the
                            75
                            cm projection create a subtle relief, so that from certain angles you see only the
                            silhouette;
                            from others, the full depth of layered panels and interlocking shapes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In sixty seconds, you’ve sensed the dialogue between ancient myth and modern craft: the
                            Etruscan
                            deity reborn in a language of clean lines and natural materials. You’ve felt the tactile
                            warmth
                            of wood, observed the play of light on carved geometry, and experienced how Miniucchi’s
                            minimal
                            palette can evoke the sun’s brilliance without a single electric bulb.

                        <h3>Mythic Origins and Concept</h3>
                        <p>
                            The figure of <strong>Usil</strong> occupies a central place in the Etruscan pantheon as the
                            personification of the sun—akin to the Greek Helios and the Roman Sol. In the fragmented
                            texts
                            of Etruscan religion, Usil is depicted both rising from the sea at dawn and riding a chariot
                            across the sky. Agapito Miniucchi’s installation does not attempt a literal re-creation;
                            rather,
                            it abstracts the deity into elemental forms—rays, wings, circular apertures—that speak of
                            illumination, passage, and cyclical renewal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Commissioned by the Comune di Terni for its CAOS Museum collection, Miniucchi was challenged
                            to
                            produce a work that would resonate with local history—Terni lies on the ancient border of
                            Etruria—and yet speak to universal themes of light and transformation. His choice of wood as
                            primary medium alludes to both the organic (the living world bathed in sunlight) and the
                            artisanal traditions of Umbrian craftsmen.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Materials and Fabrication</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Format:</strong> Carved and painted wood panels (legno)<br>
                            <strong>Dimensions:</strong> H 166 cm × W 50 cm × D 75 cm
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Miniucchi selects sustainably sourced poplar and birch plywood—materials prized for their
                            fine
                            grain and stability. Each panel is cut with CNC precision, then hand-filed to soften edges
                            and
                            transitions. The layered construction consists of a backing plane anchored to the wall, over
                            which successive relief panels are applied, creating the 75 cm projection in staggered
                            steps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Surface treatment involves a two-stage process: first, a sealant to protect the wood; then a
                            series of thin washes of acrylic mixed with metallic gold and ochre pigments. These washes
                            allow
                            the wood’s natural striations to show through, generating subtle iridescence under changing
                            gallery lights. Finally, a matte varnish unifies the finish and guards against UV fading.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Iconography and Visual Language</h3>
                        <p>
                            The installation’s central silhouette is crowned with a halo of triangular rays—twelve in
                            number, echoing solar cycles and months of the year. Below the halo, a pair of stylized
                            wings
                            spread laterally, each wing panel carved with geometric line patterns that reference both
                            Etruscan textile motifs and contemporary abstraction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Circular cut-outs—ranging from 5 to 15 cm in diameter—are strategically placed to align with
                            gallery spotlights, transforming overhead lighting into “sunbeams” that pierce the wood and
                            cast
                            dappled patterns onto the surrounding walls. In this way, the viewer becomes part of the
                            work,
                            moving through shafts of refracted light.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Spatial Experience and Installation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Installed at eye level, the piece’s base sits 50 cm off the floor, encouraging viewers to
                            look
                            up—an intentional gesture that mimics gazing toward the sky at sunrise. The 166 cm height
                            approximates a human figure, further anthropomorphizing the abstract form. At 75 cm depth,
                            the
                            work intrudes comfortably into the gallery space without obstructing circulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Miniucchi worked closely with CAOS’s curatorial team to calibrate lighting angles and sight
                            lines. Through mock-ups and on-site tests, he determined the ideal positioning of each
                            circular
                            aperture so that midday gallery light would align with the piece’s geometry, reinforcing its
                            solar narrative.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Cultural Significance and Reception</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since its unveiling in 2019, <em>Usil</em> has become a focal point for discussions of
                            contemporary archaeological dialogue—how modern art can reinterpret ancient symbols without
                            resorting to pastiche. Critics have praised Miniucchi’s restraint: by stripping Usil’s
                            iconography to its barest essentials, he creates a work that is at once immediately legible
                            and
                            continually open to interpretation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Visitors often pause beneath the piece to experience the play of light and shadow, likening
                            the
                            effect to standing in a grove of sun-dappled trees. Educational programs at CAOS have
                            incorporated the installation into workshops on geometry in art, solar symbolism, and
                            sustainable craft.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Conservation and Care</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Conservation:</strong> Buono<br>
                            <strong>Keeper:</strong> Comune di Terni (Aurelio De Felice – CAOS Museum)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wood-based installations require stable environmental conditions: CAOS maintains gallery
                            temperatures between 18–22 °C and relative humidity at 45–55 % to prevent warping or
                            splitting.
                            The layered construction allows for disassembly: each relief panel is keyed into slots on
                            the
                            backing plane and can be removed for individual inspection.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Legacy and Ongoing Dialogue</h3>
                        <p>
                            Miniucchi’s <em>Usil</em> continues to inspire reinterpretations of Etruscan myth in
                            contemporary media—from digital animations to public murals. It stands as a model for how
                            museums can commission new works that both honor regional heritage and expand the boundaries
                            of
                            exhibition practice.
