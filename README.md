# Vallecupola Ecosystem Exhibition

**Vallecupola** is a small mountain village in central Italy, a hamlet of **Rocca Sinibalda (RI)** located in the **Sabina** region. Rich in art and history, it houses a library-museum dedicated to the poet, writer, sculptor, and Etruscologist **Angelo Di Mario**. The village also inspired and serves as the main setting for a short story bearing its name, which was a finalist for the **Premio Campiello Giovani 2024**, one of Italy's most prestigious literary awards.

## About the Project

**Vallecupola Ecosystem** is a project developed by students from the **Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge** Master's program at the University of Bologna. Our goal is to unveil the village's hidden cultural value and its connections to diverse artistic content, demonstrating how even a small village can become the center of an extensive cultural network.

The project creates both a comprehensive knowledge base and an interactive virtual exhibition, leveraging Linked Open Data principles to offer users a complete experience.
