                        <strong>Usil</strong> is a site-specific installation created in 2019 by contemporary Italian
                        artist Agapito Miniucchi, exhibited at the Aurelio De Felice ‚Äì CAOS Museum in Terni. The work
                        takes its title and inspiration from the Etruscan sun-deity Usil, reinterpreting ancient myth
                        through modern materials and form. Composed primarily of carved and assembled wood
                        panels‚Äîmeasuring 166 cm high, 50 cm wide, and 75 cm deep‚Äîthe installation combines sculptural
                        relief with painted surfaces to evoke the sun‚Äôs radiance and the mythic aura of its divine
                        bearer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Miniucchi‚Äôs <em>Usil</em> fuses minimalist geometry with rich symbolic motifs: stylized rays,
                        angular wings, and circular apertures recall both archaic depictions of the god and solar
                        iconography across cultures. The warm, honeyed tones of the wood are enhanced by subtle washes
                        of gold and ochre paint, producing a luminescent effect under gallery lighting. In commissioning
                        the piece, the Comune di Terni sought to bridge local heritage with contemporary art‚ÄîMiniucchi‚Äôs
                        installation thus stands as a dialog between past and present, ritual and display.

                    <p>
                        Step into the CAOS Museum‚Äôs gallery and you‚Äôll be met by <em>Usil</em>, a soaring wooden
                        structure that channels the power of the Etruscan sun-god. At eye level, the central figure‚Äîan
                        abstracted, winged silhouette‚Äîappears to emerge from the plane of the wall, its carved contours
                        catching light and shadow with every degree of your turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reach out and brush your fingertips over the smooth, sanded panels. You‚Äôll feel the gentle
                        undulations where the rays extend‚Äîeach a precise bevel that radiates outward like a compass
                        rose. The warm wood grain underpins a wash of translucent gold: not an opaque veneer, but a
                        whisper of pigment that glimmers as you pass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step back a pace. The installation fills your peripheral vision, its verticality (166 cm tall)
                        dominating the space without overwhelming it. The broader wingspan (50 cm each side) and the 75
                        cm projection create a subtle relief, so that from certain angles you see only the silhouette;
                        from others, the full depth of layered panels and interlocking shapes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In sixty seconds, you‚Äôve sensed the dialogue between ancient myth and modern craft: the Etruscan
                        deity reborn in a language of clean lines and natural materials. You‚Äôve felt the tactile warmth
                        of wood, observed the play of light on carved geometry, and experienced how Miniucchi‚Äôs minimal
                        palette can evoke the sun‚Äôs brilliance without a single electric bulb.

                    <h3>Mythic Origins and Concept</h3>
                    <p>
                        The figure of <strong>Usil</strong> occupies a central place in the Etruscan pantheon as the
                        personification of the sun‚Äîakin to the Greek Helios and the Roman Sol. In the fragmented texts
                        of Etruscan religion, Usil is depicted both rising from the sea at dawn and riding a chariot
                        across the sky. Agapito Miniucchi‚Äôs installation does not attempt a literal re-creation; rather,
                        it abstracts the deity into elemental forms‚Äîrays, wings, circular apertures‚Äîthat speak of
                        illumination, passage, and cyclical renewal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commissioned by the Comune di Terni for its CAOS Museum collection, Miniucchi was challenged to
                        produce a work that would resonate with local history‚ÄîTerni lies on the ancient border of
                        Etruria‚Äîand yet speak to universal themes of light and transformation. His choice of wood as
                        primary medium alludes to both the organic (the living world bathed in sunlight) and the
                        artisanal traditions of Umbrian craftsmen.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Materials and Fabrication</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Format:</strong> Carved and painted wood panels (legno)<br>
                        <strong>Dimensions:</strong> H 166 cm √ó W 50 cm √ó D 75 cm
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Miniucchi selects sustainably sourced poplar and birch plywood‚Äîmaterials prized for their fine
                        grain and stability. Each panel is cut with CNC precision, then hand-filed to soften edges and
                        transitions. The layered construction consists of a backing plane anchored to the wall, over
                        which successive relief panels are applied, creating the 75 cm projection in staggered steps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surface treatment involves a two-stage process: first, a sealant to protect the wood; then a
                        series of thin washes of acrylic mixed with metallic gold and ochre pigments. These washes allow
                        the wood‚Äôs natural striations to show through, generating subtle iridescence under changing
                        gallery lights. Finally, a matte varnish unifies the finish and guards against UV fading.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Iconography and Visual Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        The installation‚Äôs central silhouette is crowned with a halo of triangular rays‚Äîtwelve in
                        number, echoing solar cycles and months of the year. Below the halo, a pair of stylized wings
                        spread laterally, each wing panel carved with geometric line patterns that reference both
                        Etruscan textile motifs and contemporary abstraction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Circular cut-outs‚Äîranging from 5 to 15 cm in diameter‚Äîare strategically placed to align with
                        gallery spotlights, transforming overhead lighting into ‚Äúsunbeams‚Äù that pierce the wood and cast
                        dappled patterns onto the surrounding walls. In this way, the viewer becomes part of the work,
                        moving through shafts of refracted light.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Spatial Experience and Installation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Installed at eye level, the piece‚Äôs base sits 50 cm off the floor, encouraging viewers to look
                        up‚Äîan intentional gesture that mimics gazing toward the sky at sunrise. The 166 cm height
                        approximates a human figure, further anthropomorphizing the abstract form. At 75 cm depth, the
                        work intrudes comfortably into the gallery space without obstructing circulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Miniucchi worked closely with CAOS‚Äôs curatorial team to calibrate lighting angles and sight
                        lines. Through mock-ups and on-site tests, he determined the ideal positioning of each circular
                        aperture so that midday gallery light would align with the piece‚Äôs geometry, reinforcing its
                        solar narrative.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cultural Significance and Reception</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since its unveiling in 2019, <em>Usil</em> has become a focal point for discussions of
                        contemporary archaeological dialogue‚Äîhow modern art can reinterpret ancient symbols without
                        resorting to pastiche. Critics have praised Miniucchi‚Äôs restraint: by stripping Usil‚Äôs
                        iconography to its barest essentials, he creates a work that is at once immediately legible and
                        continually open to interpretation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visitors often pause beneath the piece to experience the play of light and shadow, likening the
                        effect to standing in a grove of sun-dappled trees. Educational programs at CAOS have
                        incorporated the installation into workshops on geometry in art, solar symbolism, and
                        sustainable craft.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conservation and Care</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Conservation:</strong> Buono<br>
                        <strong>Keeper:</strong> Comune di Terni (Aurelio De Felice ‚Äì CAOS Museum)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wood-based installations require stable environmental conditions: CAOS maintains gallery
                        temperatures between 18‚Äì22 ¬∞C and relative humidity at 45‚Äì55 % to prevent warping or splitting.
                        The layered construction allows for disassembly: each relief panel is keyed into slots on the
                        backing plane and can be removed for individual inspection.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Legacy and Ongoing Dialogue</h3>
                    <p>
                        Miniucchi‚Äôs <em>Usil</em> continues to inspire reinterpretations of Etruscan myth in
                        contemporary media‚Äîfrom digital animations to public murals. It stands as a model for how
                        museums can commission new works that both honor regional heritage and expand the boundaries of
                        exhibition practice.
